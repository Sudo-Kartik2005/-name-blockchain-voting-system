# Run tests (if test suite is implemented)
python -m pytest tests/
```

## üîß Configuration

- `DATABASE_URL`: Database connection string
- `BLOCKCHAIN_DIFFICULTY`: Mining difficulty level

### Customization
- Modify `blockchain.py` for different consensus algorithms
- Update `models.py` for additional data fields
- Customize templates in `templates/` directory
- Adjust mining parameters in `app.py`

## üöÄ Deployment Guide

### 1. Set Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file or set these variables in your hosting environment:

```
SECRET_KEY=your-very-secret-key-here
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///instance/voting_system.db  # Or your production database URI
```

### 2. Install Production Dependencies

```
pip install gunicorn  # For Linux
# or
pip install waitress  # For Windows
```

### 3. Run with a Production WSGI Server

**Linux (gunicorn):**
```
gunicorn -w 4 app:app
```

**Windows (waitress):**
```
waitress-serve --port=8080 app:app
```

### 4. Security Best Practices
- Never use the default SECRET_KEY in production.
- Always use HTTPS in production.
- Protect your database file and credentials.
- Do not run with debug=True in production.
- Regularly back up your database.
- Monitor logs for suspicious activity.

### 5. Static Files
- Serve static files (CSS, JS, images) with your web server (nginx, Apache) for best performance.
